# Hello!

Welcome to my repository! This space is primarily dedicated to projects and ideas sparked during my course CS 4510: Automata and Complexity at Georgia Tech. Please note:

- This is a **work in progress**.
- **No guarantee** of completion.

## Projects

1. **NFA Verifier**
   - **Objective:** Create a tool that allows input of a graph and a string, and then evaluates if the NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton) accepts the string.
   - **Status:** In development.
